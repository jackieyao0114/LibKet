### Quantum Computing and CSE

* History of (accelerated) computing
  * distributed parallel computing
  * GPU-/FPGA-accelerated computing
  * Quantum-accelerated computing
  
* Possible applications for Q-accelerated computing
  * Linear solvers HHL/VQLS
  * 

### Getting started with LibKet

* Design philosophy (LibKet, the CUDA for quantum-accelerated computing)

* 

### Basics of quantum computing

### Overview of quantum computing today

* Available quantum systems (IBM, Rigetti, ionQ via Amazon AWS)

* Challenges of the NISQ era

* Quantum supremacy and fault tolerance

### LibKet part 2

* Implement some algorithms in LibKet and let them run it in simulator mode

* Run it myself on real hardware

### Selected applications in CSE

* HHL/VQLS for Poisson problem
