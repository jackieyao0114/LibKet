Exceptions are the QuEST and QX simulators where a reference to the internal state vector is returned.\n\n#### ``LibKet::QJob* device.execute(...)`` \noffloads the quantum computation to the quantum device and returns a ``QJob`` pointer once the quantum computation has completed.\n\n#### ``LibKet::QJob* device.execute_async(...)`` \noffloads the quantum computation to the quantum device and returns a ``QJob`` pointer immediately.\n\nAll three methods have the same interface.
